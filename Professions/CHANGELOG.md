# PRFS Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Beta release for 1.6

### Changed

* Prestige levels no longer require having all professions in the skill. It is now a reward for Mastering each skill. The Statue of Prestige has been renamed to Statue of Transcendence to avoid confusion. All prestiged profession variants have been reworked to be more impactful end-game rewards.
* Skill reset feature is unchanged. But note that choosing to Master a skill will prevent it from being reset further, effectively locking you out of any unobtained profession.
* Limit Break is now a reward for Mastering the Combat skill.
* Profession changes:
    * **Prestiged Agriculturist:** Now also allows crops to live through one day out-of-season.
    * **Prestiged Artisan:** Now also adds to Artisan machines a chance to preserve their input.
    * **Prestiged Breeder:**
    * **Prestiged Producer:**
    * **Ecologist:** Quality is now based on variety of forages found, instead of an arbitrary number of total forages collected.
    * **Prestiged Ecologist:**
    * **Prestiged Scavenger:** Now also increases the max number of forageable items that can be spawned on a map and adds extra attempts of spawning forage, depending on your Scavenger Hunt streak (or the highest streak amongst all online players).
    * **Prestiged Arborist:**
    * **Prestiged Tapper:** Now also doubles the yield of recipes which consume syrups.
    * **Prestiged Spelunker:**
    * **Prestiged Prospector:** Now also increases the number of spawned mining nodes on each levels depending on your Prospector Hunt streak.
    * **Demolitionist:** Extra resource chance doubled to 40%.
    * **Prestiged Demolitionist:** Extra resource chance doubled to 80%, and now also doubles the efficiency of all machines that consume or produce coal.
        * Machines which consume coal (Furnaces, Fish Smoker) will be able to process twice before needing a coal refill. The inputs and outputs are unchanged.
        * Machines which produce coal (Charcoal Kiln) will double the amount produced.
    * **Gemologist:** Removed Crystalarium processing time. Added 50% chance for gems to appear in pairs (same as vanilla Geologist). Quality is now based on variety of minerals and gems found, instead of an arbitrary number of total minerals collected.
    * **Prestiged Gemologist:** Removed Crystalarium processing time. Added 50% chance for gems to appear in triplets, and also allows Crystalaria to replicate input quality.
    * **Angler:** Bonus fish sale value now once again only considers max-sized fish caught.
    * **Prestiged Angler:**
    * **Prestiged Aquarist:**
    * **Prestiged Luremaster:** Now also adds a small chance to preserve bait.
    * **Prestiged Brute:**

    * **Prestiged Rascal:** Now also allows firing both ammo slots at once by holding the Mod key. This is now required to apply equipped Monster Musk.
