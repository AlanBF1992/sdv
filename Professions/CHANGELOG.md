# PRFS Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Beta release for 1.6

### Changed

* Prestige levels no longer require having all professions in the skill. It is now a reward for Mastering each individual skill. The Statue of Prestige has been renamed to Statue of Transcendence to avoid confusion. 
* Skill reset feature is unchanged. But note that choosing to Master a skill will prevent it from being reset further, effectively locking you out of any unobtained profession. *This may change in the future, but for now you have been warned.*
* Similarly, the Limit Break is now a reward for Mastering the Combat skill.
* All prestiged profession variants, and a few base variants, have been reworked. Prestige professions are now much more impactful end-game rewards. Please review the section [Professions](README.md#professions) of the README to learn more.
* Misc. code improvements.

### Removed

* Removed support for Luck skill and Love of Cooking. I might re-add Love of Cooking support if it gets updated.
* Removed alost all third-party mod integrations since I don't know which of them were/will be updated. I might re-add Automate integration later, or I might not.
